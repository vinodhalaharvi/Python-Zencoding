I have added few python snippets to zencoding plugin, written by Sergey Chikuyonok.

So,
class>def*3>foritems 
expands to:
class ClassName (object):
	
	"""
		@name:
		@description:
		@params:
		@returns:
	"""
	def fname(self, *args, **kwargs):
		
		for k, v in dct.items():
			
	
	"""
		@name:
		@description:
		@params:
		@returns:
	"""
	def fname(self, *args, **kwargs):
		
		for k, v in dct.items():
			
	
	"""
		@name:
		@description:
		@params:
		@returns:
	"""
	def fname(self, *args, **kwargs):
		
		for k, v in dct.items():
